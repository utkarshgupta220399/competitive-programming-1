# Competitive-Programming

## Contributing Guidelines

Teamwork makes the dream work :)

It's always delightful to have someone along in a journey. With that being said, let's straight dive into the TODOs & contribution rules -

### TODOs

As simple as the repo description -
* Add codes for missing Algorithm & Data structure implementations in C++.
* Add Standard problems along with their solutions in C++.

### Submission

1. Please be careful about casing of letters & naming of files for a pull request to successfully merge.
    * File naming should be done in below way -
    * For example - If you implement a linear search, file should be named as linear-search.cpp
2. Code must be highly readable. Make sure to describe parameters of a function in comment, if using arbitrary names for them.

For e.g. - 
```cpp
    // Parameters: (Array, Array size, Element to be searched) <----
    int linearSearch(int a[], int n, int key) {
        .
        .
        .
    }
```

3. Use camel case style while writing code to make them look clean.
4. Only write the functional part of the code. No need to include libraries & other stuffs.
5. Comment only when it is necessary. The aim of this repository is not to explain the algorithm to the reader, but to provide him a clean implementation of the code for reference.
6. Don't forget to leave a commit message about what change you made :)

### Rules

1. Please do not submit confidential resources.
2. To make changes in an existing file, mention the same along with the reason behind it before actually submitting a PR.

If there is still something you want to add up, please feel free to raise issues :)

That's it.
Thank you for showing your interest in the repository :)
